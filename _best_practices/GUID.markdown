# Best Practice - Creating a Meaningful GUID Prefix 

What is a GUID Prefix? Before you make any decisions about one, you should know what it is. Start by reading the [GUID Prefix Documentation ](https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/catalog.html#guid-prefix).

## General Recommendations for GUID Prefix 

We recommend choosing a GUID_PREFIX that will survive being transferred through various mechanisms, displayed in web pages that might use “fancy” formatting, or typed by users with many kinds of input devices in many languages. This means using only upper and lower-case ASCII letters (A-Z,a-z), other than the required colon. 

### Before the Colon - Institutional Acronym

We recommend that the characters before the colon match an existing institutional acronym if one has already been in use, especially if it is recorded in a directory such as the <a href="http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/" class="external">Index Herbariorum</a>. This makes finding legacy collection use and publication easier and also helps those who have worked with your colelction in the past find your newly published records in Arctos.

### After the Colon - Colletion Acronym

We recommend that the characters after the colon provide a briedescription of the colletion.
