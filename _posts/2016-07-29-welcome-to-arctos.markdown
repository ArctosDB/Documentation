Welcome to the new home of the Arctos Tips and Tutorials that we have amassed in the wiki. We've outgrown the wiki organization so things are hectic for now as we migrate to the new home.

We're using the Jekyll Documentation Theme so a learning curve for that as well.
_Stay tuned!_

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
