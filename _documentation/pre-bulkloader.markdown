The pre-bulkloader is a specimen data cleanup tool.

Data must first be transformed into Arctos Specimen Bulkloader format with [proper column names](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/bulkloader.html).

# Correction and Repatriation

After the status has changed to init_pull_complete, several tables will be available for download and correction.

## Agent

pre_bulk_agent will contain two columns: AGENT_NAME and SHOULDBE. These data come from unique values in all agent columns.

Multi-agent strings ("You and Me") must be dealt with using other tools.

Once each AGENT_NAME represents a single entity, a "translation" should be entered in the SHOULDBE column.

| AGENT_NAME        | SHOULDBE           | explanation  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| Guy, Some      | Some Guy | Formatting Agents according to the [Agent Creation Guidelines](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/agent.html#creating--maintaining-agents) now will save some work later on. |
| S. Guy      | Some Guy  |  Merging alternate names now will save some work later on. If there's reason to suspect that this is NOT "Some Guy" it may be best to pre-create the agents with a "not the same as" relationship. |
| Some Guy | Some Guy      |   Most records will probably be as good as they can be made at this point, and just need copy/pasted from AGENT_NAME to SHOULDBE, which will result in no changes. |

## Taxa

pre_bulk_taxa will contain two columns: TAXON_NAME and SHOULDBE. These data come from unique values in all agent columns. Data appear here when the bulkloader cannot resolve them to names according to the [handled formulae](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/bulkloader.html#taxonomy). Common situations:

* The name is valid and correctly formatted, just not in Arctos. This situation should be relatively rare, particular for species-and-above names. This must be resolved by creating the name in Arctos. A DBA can bulkload confirmed names, or they can be created individually in Arctos. The name should be copied to  SHOULDBE in conjunction with being added to Arctos.
* The name is misspelled. This is by far the most common situation. The corrected named should be entered in SHOULDBE.
* A formula is not formatted correctly. See [handled formulae](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/bulkloader.html#taxonomy).

A blank value in TAXON_NAME must be addressed. "unidentifiable" is available if no information is available. Often more precision can be inferred - bird collections tend to catalog Aves, for example. ("unidentifiable" has no implicit limitations in scope.)
