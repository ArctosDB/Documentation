# Specimen Parts



Parts are physical entities, in contrast to[Cataloged
Items](/documentation/catalog/) (an abstract entity) or binary objects
(such as Images).  One or many parts may comprise a Cataloged Item, and
parts may be defined as the minimal units for which [storage
location](/documentation/container/), usage, and condition are
tracked. (*“Parts are things to which you can stick barcodes.”*) In many
collections, parts are nearly always “whole organisms” but in others,
such as vertebrate paleontology, the variety of parts is huge.

Embryos and parasites may be treated parts of the host organism. 
Ideally, embryos should be treated as separate cataloged items because
they may have, or they may acquire, attributes distinct from those of
their mothers.  Nevertheless it is often practical to consider them as
parts of the mother until such time as they do acquire separate
attributes.  Similarly, parasites have been recorded as parts of their
hosts until such time as they might be worked into a separate parasite
collection.

Specimen_Part.Part_Name

VARCHAR(70) not null

[ctspecimen_part_name](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctspecimen_part_name)

```



**Part Names:** What we choose to name as a part depends on what we
define as a part,  and while this is often obvious (*e.g.,* “whole
organism”), organisms become separated into parts in ways both
standardized and not.  Thus, it is difficult to standardize vocabulary
for every fragment worthy of preservation.

Vocabulary is controlled by a[code
table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctspecimen_part_name). 
Part names should refer to specific anatomical parts or recognized
groups of parts (*e.g.*, “postcranial skeleton”).  With rare exception,
parts are the singular form of a noun.  In some cases, where the parts
may be a batch of indefinite size, the plural is included
parenthetically (*e.g.,* “endoparasite(s)”).

Parts, when separable, should be entered on individual lines of the
parts grid as individual

collection objects. Distinct parts should be entered on separate lines,
*e.g*., ***skull*** and ***postcranial skeleton***.  A ***postcranial
skeleton*** is considered a single part. Parts

already contained in the ***postcranial skeleton*** may be entered on
separate lines for clarity.  An acceptable entry might be:

> skull

> postcranial skeleton (partial)

> right humerus \[part condition: broken\]

Such an entry would designate a postcranial skeleton that has a broken

right humerus. Situations like this are typically discovered during

loans, are almost always unique, and should be dealt with on a case by

case basis.

Part name contains information once split out into part modifier, and
also preservation and storage information. Preservation and storage
information (eg, “reproductive tract (formalin-fixed, 70% ethanol)”) is
not meant to replace container condition information (e.g.,
“checked-by-on-date” and fluid_preservation_history), but simply to
facilitate searching.

“Traditional” (a concept which varies wildly by discipline and
collection) part names are often stored without “modifiers.” A
“skeleton” in a mammal collection probably consists of cleaned, dried
bones stored at room temperature, for example.

The specimen part code table also contains a “is_tissue” flag. Parts
flagged as “tissues” indicate a Specimen Part is a sample intended for
subsampling and distribution, generally for purposes of destructive
analysis, or simply a part with readily-available tissue from which DNA
may be extracted. In general, these parts are soft organs, or parts
thereof, preserved by freezing. Such samples commonly supply DNA for
sequence analysis, and many researchers want to search for specimens
from which they can readily obtain subsamples.

Coll_Object.Disposition

VARCHAR(20) not null

[ctcoll_obj_disp](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctcoll_obj_disp)

```



**Disposition** describes the status of parts and, as an abstract
generality,

the status of cataloged items.  Typical values are:

-   in collection
-   being processed
-   on loan
-   missing
-   destroyed

```

Coll_Object.Condition

VARCHAR(255) not null

```



**Condition** is used for entries such as “broken” or “dissected”.

-   5 – The best tissues. These have gone from a freshly killed animal
    directly into liquid nitrogen. The animal should not have been dead
    for more than thirty minutes.
-   4 – These are tissues taken from animals only a few hours post
    mortem at cool temperatures. Such tissues should not have been
    previously frozen and thawed.
-   3 – These are tissues taken from an animal that has been dead less
    than sixteen hours at cool temperatures, or tissues taken from an
    animal that was hard frozen soon after death and then thawed
    for preparation. Fur is not slipping.
-   2 – These tissues may be beginning to show signs of decomposition.
-   1 – These tissues are flaccid and thoroughly autolyzed. They
    probably stink.

```

Coll_Object.Lot_Count

NUMBER not null

```



A **Lot Count** is an integer that enumberates how many similar items
comprise a part.  The value is frequently one (1), but collections of
fish and invertebrates usually assign a single catalog number to all of
the individual organisms of one species from one collecting event. 
Thus, 86 minnows of one species from one place, collected at the same
time, and stored together in one jar of alcohol would be a cataloged
item with one part,and that part would have a lot count of 86 whole
animals.

+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

Lot counts are not static; lots may be split into smaller lots by
creating a separate part.  If one of those 86 minnows was prepared for
skeletal study by clearing and staining, it would be necessary to create
a second “part” within the catalogued item.

A cryotube of embryos or a box of ribs should have a lot count.  In
contrast, three tubes of muscle from an individual will be tracked
separately;  these should be entered as three collection objects, each
with a lot count of one.

There must be a value of at least one (1) for each part, and the maximum
is 99999. Lot counts are sometimes approximate. For example, a
three-liter jar of small minnows in alcohol might be given a lot count
of 400, at least until such time as someone counts the minnows.

Specimen_Part.Sampled_From_Obj_Id

NUMBER null

```



**Sampled From** designates a part derived from another part. This is
intended to be a subsample supplied to an investigator for destructive
analysis. therefore it often applies to parts that are no longer in the
collection, but if the subsamples or extracts thereof are returned,
these can be tracked.
