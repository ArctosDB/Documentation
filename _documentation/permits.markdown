# Permits

Permits are documentation authorizing transactions such as [Accessions](/documentation/accession) and [Loans](/documentation/loans).

In general, permits are issued by governmental agencies, but letters
authorizing collecting activities on private land can also be considered permits.

Some "registrations" may also constitute permits. For example, museums can do international exchanges of specimens of
endangered species if the museums are registered with their respective governments under the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In this case, it is the institutional certificates of CITES registration that constitute the authority.
