# Sample file

This is a sample document for a collection.

This document is under the `_documentation` directory which means that it should fall under the "Documentation" collection.

More about collections [can be seen on the Jekyll page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).

# This is a header

## This is a subheader

### What about three layers deep?

That'd be nice.
