# Specimen Results

Specimen results presents summary specimen data in a tabular format.

## Features

### Requery

Click "show/hide search terms" near the top of the page to alter your query term(s).

### Map

Click "show map" near the top of the page to view a map. Note that the map shows only "preferred" events.

The size of the map is customizable, and may be used to limit results to the bounding box defined by the map viewport.
