# Specimen Results

Specimen results presents summary specimen data in a tabular format. 

## Features

### Requery

Click "show/hide search terms" near the top of the page to alter your query term(s).

### Map

Click "show map" near the top of the page to view a map. Note that the map shows only "preferred" events.

The size of the map is customizable, and may be used to limit results to the bounding box defined by the map viewport.

### Customize

Open the Tools: Map, Customize, or Download option for customization.



## Limitations

Specimen data are often much more complex than can readily be represented in a tabular format. Arctos provides embedded data object
to address the most common situations. 

Many queries also consider only "preferred" or "most important" data (often an arbitrary distinction). Contact us for more information.

### Locality

Many specimens have multiple locality associations. Only one is generally available. Turn on "JSON Locality" to see all locality data.

### Parts

Specimen Parts are presented as concatenated strings. Turn on "partdetail" to see individual parts (as JSON).

### Identifications

Only the current accepted identifications is shown by default. Turn on "ID History (JSON)" to see all identifications.
