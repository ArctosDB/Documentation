all collections.

Agents are fully shared, and thousands of agents span collections – as
collectors, borrowers, authors, and georeferencers. Changes to Agents
should be coordinates by all users (available from Agent Activity).
Major changes (such as mergers) prompt notifications and have a waiting
period.

Publications and Projects are shared globally. Researchers borrowing
specimens from several collections may create shared Projects which
produce shared Publications citing multiple collections.

Media are shared globally. PDFs of shared publications are one use case;
field notes of hosts and parasites are another.

Containers are shared globally, facilitating the combined storage of
e.g., parasites and “part parasites” belonging to vertebrate
collections.

Higher Geography is shared globally. Localities are optionally shared,
and are locked when shared; only users with access to all collections
using a shared locality may edit it. Events are shared similar to
localities.
