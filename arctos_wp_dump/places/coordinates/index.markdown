Coordinates are stored with collecting events and with locality, both
optional. Collecting event coordinates are “verbatim” and should reflect
some data associated with specimen events. Locality coordinates are part
of georeferences, and may be standardizations or corrections of, or
additions to verbatim coordinates.

Any locality has zero or one coordinate assertions. “Unaccepted
coordinates” are handled by having multiple specimen events referencing
multiple localities.

Data Entry has (for brevity) one place for coordinate information, and
these data are stored as both verbatim and locality coordinates. Events
and localities may be pre-made and selected when these limitations
prevent accurately representing the data.

**Original Units** for geographic coordinates vary with the source of
the data.  Classically, latitude and longitude have been recorded in
degrees, minute and seconds.  Now, modern GIS applications generally use
degrees only, including decimal fractions for all levels of precision. 
In Arctos, coordinates are stored and displayed in their original
format.  Except for UTMs, coordinates are also translated to, and stored
as, decimal degrees for standardization and mapping.  There is not yet
programming to convert UTMs to decimal degrees. Include as many digits
of precision as are provided in the original data.  Forms in Arctos are
customized according to which format is chosen, and the vocabulary and
formats are defined and described by a [code
table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTLAT_LONG_UNITS).

In all formats, include as many digits of precision as are provided in

**Datum:** The geodetic datum to which the latitude and longitude refer.
A geodetic datum describes the size, shape, origin, and orientation of a
coordinate system for mapping the earth. Latitude and longitude data
referenced to the wrong datum can result in positional errors of
hundreds of meters. Therefore, when providing latitude and longitude
data, it is important to know from which datum those data are derived.
Most GPS units allow you to select the geodetic data from which its
coordinates will be determined (default usually set to WGS84, but this
should be checked in the field). Maps and gazetteers generally provide
this information as well.\

**Reference Source(s)** refers to the source of the coordinates and not
to the source of the error. Coordinates may be original data collected
with the specimen, or they may be provided by after-the-fact
georeferencing efforts. In the latter situation, data in Source(s)
should be specific enough to allow anyone in the future to use the same
resources to validate the coordinates, or to georeference the same
locality. These data might be a list of maps, gazetteers or other
resources used to georeference the locality. Examples:

-   USGS 1:24000 Florence Montana Quad
-   Dictionary of Alaska Place Names (Orth, 1967)
-   Geographic Names Canada (NRC website)
-   Geographic Names Information System (USGS website)

In cases where the coordinates are original data, a description of the
original source should be provided. Again, these data should make the
coordinates as verifiable as possible by referring to records associated
with the specimen. Examples:

-   collector’s notation
-   preparator’s notation
-   specimen label
-   accession file
-   global positioning system (download)

</div>

**Maximum Uncertainty Distance** is the upper limit of the horizontal
(as opposed to elevational) distance from the reported latitude and
longitude. It describes a circle within which the whole of the described
locality lies. Leave the value empty if the uncertainty is unknown,
cannot be estimated, or is not applicable (because there are no
coordinates). Zero is not a valid value. Maximum Uncertainty is the sum
of GPSAccuracy, Extent, and all other sources of error or imprecision.

This is a simple concept, but there are several sources of error which,
when correctly combined, often demonstrate a value larger than intuition
might suggest. These sources of error are enumerated in the MaNIS
Guidelines, and are combined into estimates of total error by the
Georeferencing Calculator.

In some circumstances the greatest source of error is the behavior of
the collector and/or any intermediary sources of the data. For example,
if a locality names a village, the collector may have obtained specimens
from a resident who forages over a large area near the village. The
collector may even have provided coordinates for the village, often from
some standard source, implying specificity equal to the extent of the
village. Estimating error can therefore be subjective, and conservative
interpretation demands large values for Maximum Uncertainty. To avoid
ambiguous or misleading locality descriptions, see [MVZ’s
guidelines](http://mvz.berkeley.edu/Locality_Field_Recording.html).

Note that there is no error inherent to coordinates.
{Dec\_Lat=12,Dec\_Long=34} is precisely the same point as
{Dec\_Lat=12.000000000000000000000000000000,Dec\_Long=34.000000000000000000000000000000}.
Make no assumptions of coordinate error or “size” (all coordinates
describe a point) based on anything other than asserted maximum error.

For most usage, including exportation to federated portals, the value
for Maximum Uncertainty is converted from the original units (recorded
here) to the value in meters.\

Lat\_Long . Determined\_By\_Agent\_id\

**Determiner** is the
[agent](http://arctosdb.wordpress.com/documentation/agent/ "Agents")
(usually a person) who determined that these coordinates and measures of
uncertainty apply to this locality. Often, this is the collector or,
dear reader, you.  The form will load with the currently logged-in user
as the default Determiner for new records.

Sometimes, a determination is developed by two or more successive
agents. For example, one agent might locate a named place and provide
the coordinates, but little or no information about the uncertainty. A
second agent might then evaluate the determination (mapping it and
comparing it to the Verbatim Locality) and then develop a Maximum
Uncertainty. In this case, we assume that the second agent has
re-evaluated the coordinates, and the determination is considered to
have been made by the second agent (*i.e.,* the agent who last modified
the determination). If there is a need to maintain the identity of the
first agent, then the second agent should create a second (separate)
determination.

If the collector offered a determination in the original data, this
determination should not be modified even if it is no longer the
accepted determination.\

### **Spatial Query**

-   Click the select icon
    ([![](/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2011/09/selector.png "selector"){.alignnone
    .size-full .wp-image-667 width="18"
    height="18"}](/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2011/09/selector.png)) to
    add a spatial query box to the map. Click the X to start over. Click
    and drag the box to select an area on the map. The northeast and
    southwest corner coordinates of the selected area are indicated on
    the line above the map.
-   Use the search box above the map to locate features or places. This
    searches the map, NOT Arctos specimens.
-   You may click the zoom icon in the select tool to zoom the map to
    the approximate size of the select tool. Scrollwheel and map control
    zoom work too.
-   Spatial query can be used alone, or in combination with any other
    search parameters.
-   Not all records can be found with a spatial query. As of March 2013,
    78% of the records represented in Arctos have been documented with
    geographic coordinates. Within individual collections, this
    proportion ranges from all to none.
-   Localities are not simply points, but circles indicating precision.
    (Some have radius 0, which should be interpreted as “NULL” rather
    than “infinitely precise,” and some are very large.) Choose the
    “query by points and error” option to find specimens by error (the
    match is “any overlap”) rather than only by coordinate points. Error
    is represented as a simplified rectangle and may be especially
    inaccurate at high latitudes and large errors.
-   All records are plotted on the geodetic datum WGS84, irrespective of
    the datum on which they were recorded. Such untransformed non-WGS84
    records may be misplaced by as much as half a kilometer. The
    original datum is documented for individual records.

For example, this query:
