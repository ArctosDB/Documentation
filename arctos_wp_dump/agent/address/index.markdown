allowed in mailing addresses, which will display in a textarea on the
edit agent form. Other address types use HTML5 datatype controls.
Mailing or shipping addresses should be of the format:

Agent Name, Job Title\
Full Mailing Address\
Street, State, etc. as required\
Zip Code or Equivalent, Country Code

Do not abbreviate except according to postal guidelines. Make no
assumptions – “local” mailing addresses may be used for returning
foreign shipments, and should therefore include country code. Phone
numbers should include country and area codes, URIs should include
protocol (http://), etc.

Remarks
-------

**Remarks:** Any necessary explanation of the address. Examples might
include:

-   Sabbatical address during academic year 04/05.
-   Not valid for Federal Express deliveries.
-   Jones uses home address in June and July.
