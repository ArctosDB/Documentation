# Why Use GitHub for Arctos?

* GitHub serves as the primary means of communication between Arctos developers and users.

* GitHub is the place to go for the [Arctos Handbook](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/) that will help you function as an Arctos user or operator. 

* If you have an Arctos Issue, post it on the [Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues) site. There you can also view and comment on issues.

* Guide to [How to Use Issues in Arctos](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/how_to/How-to-Use-Issues-in-Arctos.html).

* Developers who are interested in Arctos code can view it in the [ArctosDB/arctos](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos) and [ArctosDB/DDL](https://github.com/ArctosDB/DDL) repositories.

## How to Get Started in GitHub

* Set up a new (and free) account in GitHub. Go to [http://github.com](http://github.com) and fill out the form with a username, email address, and password. Your username will be your screen name. Your email address will be used to send notifications.

* Click the big green button to "Sign up for GitHub."

## What You Can Do in GitHub

* Anyone can view, post, or comment on an Issue (<https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues>). 
You do not need special permissions to do this. Without special permissions, however, you cannot label an issue,
 close an issue, assign an issue to another person, or assign a milestone to an issue.

* Any active Arctos user may request permission to become a member of the "Users" team. 
"Users" may create and/or edit Arctos Handbook and organize (assign labels and milestone or vote by reacting) Issues. 
To become a member of this team, send an email with your GitHub username to dustymc@gmail.com and 
ccicero@berkeley.edu. 
See [instructions](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/how_to/How-to-Create-or-Edit-Content-on-the-Arctos-Wiki) on how to 
create and/or edit content in the documentation-wiki repository.

* Only people with administrative permissions can add new members. To do that, go to [https://github.com/ArctosDB](https://github.com/ArctosDB) and click on "Invite someone" at the bottom of the People pane on the right of the window. Search by the person's GitHub username and enter it where prompted. Select the person to add. He/she will need to accept the membership invitation in order to become a member. When you invite someone, the default role is 'member' versus 'owner' which has more administrative privileges. 

* Members who are assigned to the 'Users' team have access to the documentation code where they can create and 
edit pages for the Arctos Handbook 
[Documentation and How-to Guides](https://github.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/wiki/Index-to-Arctos-Documentation-and-How-To-Guides).
 They cannot invite other members, however, without additional administrative privileges.

* If you want to receive notifications (e.g., data issues) from VertNet, your GitHub account needs to be added to the VertNet 
repository for your collection. For more information, read 
the [VertNet Guide to Issue Tracking](http://vertnet.org/resources/issuetrackingguide.html).

**TIP**: Documentation pages are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which is dead simple 
to learn. [Here's a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
