# Why Use GitHub for Arctos?

* GitHub serves as the primary means of communication between Arctos developers and users.

* GitHub is where Arctos users can contribute to the [Arctos Handbook](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/) via the [Arctos Documentation-wiki Repository](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/). 

* If you have an Arctos Issue, post it on the [Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues) site. There you can also view and comment on issues.

* Guide to [How to Use Issues in Arctos](/how_to/How-to-Use-Issues-in-Arctos.html).

* Developers who are interested in Arctos code can view it in the [ArctosDB/arctos](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos) and [ArctosDB/DDL](https://github.com/ArctosDB/DDL) repositories.

## How to Get Started in GitHub

* Set up a new (and free) account in GitHub. Go to [http://github.com](http://github.com) and fill out the form with a username, email address, and password. Your username will be your screen name. Your email address will be used to send notifications.

* Click the big green button to "Sign up for GitHub."

* Edit your GitHub profile to include your name and Arctos Institution. This helps other Arctos users know who they are developing with when discussing Arctos Issues. To do this select "Profile" from the drop down in the top right corner of the GitHub page.

Then select the "Edit profile" button on the left side of your profile page.

You can add a photo to replace the GitHub generated avatar, but it isn't completely necessary. The most helpful thing you can do here is to add your name and institution so that everyone working with you in Arctos will know who you are.

Be sure to save your edits! Now you are ready to get to know GitHub!


## GitHub Membership Levels and Permissions

Anyone can view, post, or comment on an [Arctos Issue](<https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues>). 
You do not need special permissions to do this. Without special permissions, however, you cannot label an issue, close an issue, assign an issue to another person, or assign a milestone to an issue.

### Arctos Users Team
Any active Arctos user may request permission to become a member of the "[Users](https://github.com/orgs/ArctosDB/teams/users)" team. 

* "Users" may create and/or edit Arctos Handbook pages and organize (assign labels and milestone or vote by reacting) Issues. To become a member of this team, send an email with your GitHub username to dustymc@gmail.com and ccicero@berkeley.edu or mkoo@berkeley.edu. 

* Users may request AWG Task Force Meetings to finalize Issues, or groups of related Issues. Start a Doodle poll and paste the link into the Issue(s) you wish to address.

* Users have access to the documentation code where they can create and edit pages for the Arctos Handbook [Documentation and How-to Guides](https://handbook.arctosdb.org). See [instructions](/how_to/How-to-Create-or-Edit-Content-on-the-Arctos-Wiki) on how to create and/or edit content in the documentation-wiki repository.

>**TIP**: Documentation pages are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which is dead simple 
to learn. [Here's a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

* Users cannot invite other members.

### Arctos Owner Team
Arctos [Owners](https://github.com/orgs/ArctosDB/teams/db-team) have administrative permissions.

* Only people with administrative permissions can add new members. To do that, go to [https://github.com/ArctosDB](https://github.com/ArctosDB) and click on "Invite someone" at the bottom of the People pane on the right of the window. Search by the person's GitHub username and enter it where prompted. Select the person to add. He/she will need to accept the membership invitation in order to become a member. When you invite someone, the default role is 'member' versus 'owner' which has more administrative privileges. 

## VertNet, TDWG, and other GitHub Repositories
If you want to receive notifications (e.g., data issues) from VertNet, TDWG, or any other GitHub repository, your GitHub account needs to be added to them.

## Managing GitHub Notifications

Once you have created your GitHub account and joined the Arctos repository, you will begin to get email from GitHub. Because our GitHub is very active, the amount of email can be overwhelming. So, how do you avoid 100 emails a day but still stay in touch? Here are some suggestions:

### Digest Notifications

### Web Notifications - Don't get any email from GitHub
 
With a bit of discipline, you can avoid receiving any email from GitHub and still follow the conversation. In your GitHub profile, select settings > Notifications and change "watching" and "Participating" to "Web".

THEN set a reminder in your personal calendar to review GitHub issues. To do this, select the little blue bell next to your avatar.

You will be rewarded with a list of unread notifications. You can peruse the list, read the issues that interest you and mark those that don't as "read". Depending upon the level you wish to participate, you might check once or twice a day or once a week, but less than that might mean missing out on contributing to an important conversation.


### No Notifications
