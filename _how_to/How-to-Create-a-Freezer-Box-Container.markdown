# How To Create a Freeze Box Container

There are many types of containers possible in Arctos. This guide walks you through the steps of creating a freezer box as a new container. This is the first step before you can scan barcoded tissues into Arctos.

* In Arctos, go to Manage Data > Object Tracking > Create Container.

* Select "freezer box" from the dropdown list under "Container Type."

* Enter the dimensions of your freezer box (cm). A typical 81-position box is 13 (W) x 5.3 (H) x 13 (L).

* Enter the number of positions (e.g., "81"). Freezer boxes typically contain 81 or 100 positions.

* Enter a description if you want (not required).

* Select Institution from the dropdown list.

* Enter a barcode for the freezer box.

* Enter a label for the freezer box.

* Click "Create Container."

* Once you create the container, you will get a window with a pane on the right that allows you to edit the container, look at positions, etc. Edit the container to make sure that the number of positions is entered (even if you enter that number in the previous step, it doesn't always save that value so you need to enter it again). Hit "Update" to save.

* The first time you create a new freezer box, click "Positions" and Arctos will prompt you to create new positions. After you do that, a window will appear that shows the freezer box grid with the empty positions you have made (the box barcode and label will display at the top of the screen).

* You are now ready to start scanning (i.e., installing) barcoded vials into a freezer box (see [How to Install Tissue Cryovials into a Freezer Box](https://arctosdb.github.io/documentation-wiki/how_to/How-to-Install-Tissue-Cryovials-Into-a-Freezer-Box.html)).
