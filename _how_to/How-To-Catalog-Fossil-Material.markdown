# How To Catalog Fossil Material

This guide provides advice for cataloging fossil material in Arctos. A fossil is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age. Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood, oil, coal, and DNA remnants.

### Body Fossils

Fossils formed by replacement of living tissue with mineral or chemical components appear as preserved remains of an organism. These items should be cataloged with a part name that describes the body part or parts preserved. Additionally, an appropriate part preservation should be applied to describe the method of fossilization. Part preservation attributes cannot be entered or bulkloaded as part of the original specimen record, but are easily added using the Bulkload Part Attributes Tool (NEED DOCUMENTATION).

 **Part Preservation Attributes**  
 Appropriate part preservation attributes for body fossils include:

  * original tissue: fossil material which has not been mineralized and the original tissue has not been significantly chemically altered
  * permineralization:	pores of the original tissues are filled with mineral deposits
  * recrystallization:	original minerals in the skeletal tissues are converted into a new crystal structure
  * replacement:	original tissue is replaced with minerals from the surrounding water and sediment

 **Body Fossil Example**  
 As an example, the British Museum's Archaeopteryx catalog record in Arctos would include the following:

 Identification = Archaeopteryx  
 part name = skeleton  
 part preservation = permineralization  
  
 ### Trace Fossils

 Trace fossils are indirect evidence of life in the past, such as the footprints, tracks, burrows, borings, and feces left behind by animals, rather than the preserved remains of the body of the actual animal itself.

 When cataloging trace fossils, the part in Arctos is generally "trace fossil". Because there are so many methods of trace fossil creation, the part preservation attribute is an important component for trace fossils as it describes the method of fossilization. Part preservation attributes cannot be entered or bulkloaded as part of the original specimen record, but are easily added using the Bulkload Part Attributes Tool (NEED DOCUMENTATION).

 **Part Preservation Attributes**  
 Appropriate part preservation attributes for the part "trace fossil" include:

  * fossil cast:	formed by mineral deposits into the mold left by rotting organic material, resulting in a three-dimensional replica of the hard structures of a plant or animal
  * fossil imprint:	found in silt or clay, like the mold or impression fossils, but they leave behind just a two-dimensional imprint
  * fossil mold, external:	formed when a plant or animal decays completely but leaves behind an external impression of itself, like a hollow mold; no organic material is present and the organism itself is not copied
  * fossil mold, internal: formed when a plant or animal is filled in with sediment and then decays completely, leaving behind an internal impression of itself; no organic material is present and the organism itself is not copied
  
  **Coprolites**  
  Coprolites are fossilized feces, a special kind of trace fossil. Rather than using the part "trace fossil" for these, we recommend the use of the part "coprolite". 
 
### Replicas

Replicas of fossil material are often made for public exhibit, teaching, or sharing with other institutions. We recommend that such items be cataloged using the part name appropriate to the anatomy of the item replicated with the part preservation attribute "reproduction".

  **Replica Example**  
  As an example, the object record for a replica of the British Museum's Archaeopteryx would include the following:

  Identification = Archaeopteryx  
  part name = skeleton  
  part preservation = reproduction
