title: How To Upload Media to TACC
layout: default_toc

The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) offers media hosting for Arctos users through an Arctos Project allocation. If you are using TACC to store media, the files must be uploaded to TACC and accessible on the web server before creating media in Arctos
 * See [How to Create Media in Arctos](https://github.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/wiki/How-to-Create-Media-(Images))

If you want to upload a lot of large media files (e.g., 100s or 1000s of images, audio, video), and/or if you have specific processing needs, you should first contact [Chris Jordan](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/about/directory/chris-jordan) and an Arctos administrator to discuss space allocations. However, most users can follow these instructions:

* Create a TACC User account through the [TACC User Portal](http://portal.tacc.utexas.edu)
 * Direct link: [https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request)

* Once you have created a new account, it may take 24 hours or so for the account to become active
 * You should receive an email when your account is approved and ready

* Email your account username to Carla Cicero ([ccicero@berkeley.edu](mailto:ccicero@berkeley.edu)) (TACC Project Manager for Arctos) so that she can add your user account to the Arctos Project allocation
 * NOTE: MVZ Users are added to the MVZ Media & Archives Project

* You will need an SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) program in order to access the Corral system on TACC where Arctos media are stored - see the [TACC Corral User Guide](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/corral)
 * On the left you’ll see [Transferring Files Using Cyberduck](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/corral#cyberduck) - download Cyberduck or use another SFTP program

* Set up a transfer protocol:
 * Open Connection
 * Select “SFTP” from dropdown
 * Server:  login1.corral.tacc.utexas.edu
 * Username: enter your TACC portal username
 * Password: enter your TACC portal account password
 * Port number is 22

* Once you are connected, go up to the root directory and then select corral-tacc ---> tacc ---> arctos

* Each institution should have a directory for their media, e.g, /corral-tacc/tacc/arctos/mvz
 * Within that directory, you can organize your media files however you want

* TACC must ingest those files in order for them to appear on the web server: [http://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu](http://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu) - files are also processed during this stage (e.g., from dng or tiff to jpeg, wav to mp3, etc.)
 * Contact [Chris Jordan](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/about/directory/chris-jordan) when your file are ready for processing and ingestion
