# How To Manage Taxonomy Hierarchically

# Background

## Hierarchical data

Hierarchical data are those in which each term is unique and each term has zero or one parent terms.

## Structure of taxonomy

Taxonomy (as a body of literature) is not hierarchical. The "parent" of Echidna (a homonym) varies according to usage, and includes "Muraeninae" (eels) and "Viperidae" (snakes). The "parent" of "Neotoma" has changed with our understanding of evolutionary history, and has at times and according to various authors included "Cricetidae" and "Muridae."

## Structure of Arctos

The core taxonomy structure of Arctos is built to hold all of the above data and anything else which might have been considered "taxonomy" at some point. Arctos taxonomy consists of grouped, sometimes named, sometimes ordered terms. There is no enforced consistency across or within taxon names; the structure which allows varying taxon concepts also allows inconsistent data (which are programmatically indistinguishable from taxon concept assertions).

## Hierarchical data in Arctos

Arctos provides a hierarchical taxonomy management tool suitable for consistently managing large groups of taxa as hierarchical data. Hierarchical data are those in which each term is unique and has zero or one parent terms. That is, the term "Neotoma" can exist precisely one time in a hierarchy. A term can have any number of children ("Neotoma albigua", "Neotoma cinerea", etc.), and those terms may have children of their own ("Neotoma albigula albiglua"). "Neotoma" must have zero or one parent terms - "Cricetidae" or "Muridae." There is no possibility of Neotoma having two parent terms within the same hierarchy.

## Finding consistency

Data in Arctos are seldom consistent even at very small scales. For example, the Arctos classifications for Neotoma devia ([http://arctos.database.museum/name/Neotoma%20devia](http://arctos.database.museum/name/Neotoma%20devia)):

and Neotoma devia monstrabilis ([http://arctos.database.museum/name/Neotoma%20devia%20monstrabilis](http://arctos.database.museum/name/Neotoma%20devia%20monstrabilis)):

<img width="465" alt="screen shot 2018-09-14 at 9 33 52 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5720791/45563137-52e4bb00-b801-11e8-9d59-0d58a5744223.png">

diverge at the level of subfamily.

This inconsistency is not possible in hierarchical data, so the import process will attempt reconciliation. This will very likely result in orphaned ranks.

<img width="282" alt="screen shot 2018-09-14 at 9 35 28 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5720791/45563225-94756600-b801-11e8-9ce0-2328e3fbdadd.png">

In this example, the processor encountered subfamily "Neotominae" first and so "Sigmodontinae" has been ignored. It is necessary to reconcile these discrepancies before exporting the data back to Arctos. 

Dealing with these inconsistencies is a very large proportion of the work involved, and the source of all data lost in the hierarchical editor. For collections which can manage specimen data under a hierarchical taxonomy, we highly recommend avoiding sources which are edited with tools that allow the existence of inconsistent data.

## Impacts

Changing the subfamily of Neotoma in the Arctos single-record editor is a hit-or-miss prospect. A user would have to find all records which are their idea of Neotoma (e.g., exlude those which are homonyms or hemihomonyms), update each individually, and hope that the process of editing 145 records has somehow not introduced other inconsistencies.

A request for DBA update would involve a non-taxonomist attempting to match strings in a system with tens of thousands of known homonyms. This has not worked well in the past.

The classification bulkloader can work, but runs the same risk of encountering [hemi]homonyms as the DBA update. Finding the records to update becomes increasingly difficult when the names do not share strings - finding Neotoma is straightforward, but finding all genera which should be under Neotominae is effectively impossible due to variations in the data.

Importing data to the classification bulkloader comes with all of the above difficulties in finding data, but unlike other tools the editor provides reports for missed or inconsistent data. Orphaned terms provide another strong indication of inconsistency. For example, finding "Arachnida" somewhere in the Neotoma data might indicate that a homonym has been used for identifications in unexpected ways. (The classification bulkloader would simply over-write the spider classifications, potentially altering specimens in unrelated collections.)

Importing clean data - that which has not been edited by non-hierarchical tools - to the hierarchical editor involves only providing a "seed" (eg, "Neotoma" or "Cricetidae") and clicking a button.

Changing the family of Neotoma in the hierarchical editor involves only dragging the term "Neotoma" to a new parent.

A user attempting to find specimens amongst inconsistent data will almost certainly fail without knowing they've failed. For example, a search for "Neotominae" against the classification data above will find Neotoma devia but not Neotoma devia monstrabilis. Most users will not realize that they're missing a subspecies, but instead will assume that what they've found is all that's available from Arctos and move on. 

A user attempting to find specimens amongst consistent data will find all or nothing. A search for "Neotominae" against consistent data will find either all Neotoma or none. A user finding no specimens will generally realize that their result is unlikely and continue looking (perhaps by visiting a taxonomy page before performing another search). 

# Using the Hierarchial Editor

## Overview

Note that the Hierarchical tool can only be used to structure classifications in Arctos and Arctos Plants.  It cannot be used to clean up classifications in the source WoRMS (via Arctos) which is managed externally by the World Register of Marine Species. 

1. Create a dataset. This is a group of names which are managed together. Datasets are wholly arbitrary temporary "working groups" of
names which may be created for any reason and deleted at any time without affecting any "read" data.  

2. "Seed" taxa. Select taxa with which to populate a dataset. This is generally done at the level of a taxon rank (e.g., Phylum). A dataset
may be seeded any number of times; you may add records incrementally.

3. Deal with errors. Core Arctos data (and taxonomy itself) is not hierarchical, and the import scripts which convert seeded taxa
to a hierarchical structure are very likely to encounter errors which should be dealt with early in the process. Fixing errors may be best
done by editing single records in Arctos, deleting local data, and re-seeding.

4. Manage data hierarchically.

5. Export your data to the Arctos classification bulkloader.

6. Review data in the bulkloader (it will be in tabular/spreadsheet format), 
repatriate to Arctos using the classification bulkloader.

## Creating a dataset

1. Click Enter Data/Batch Tools/Hierarchical Classifications to open the editor.
2. Click Create a new Dataset
3. Enter a name, select a source classification, click Create Dataset. Source will usually be the Source your collection uses.

## Seeding

1. Enter something in one of the ranked fields on the "seed" section of the edit form. You should have been directed to the 
proper place after creating a dataset. Click the "get count" button to ensure that what you're doing matches your expectations.
The popup may take some time to appear.
2. If the popup gives a reasonable count, click pull seed data. The form will reload.
3. Wait. The import process runs asynchronously, and may take some time. Check the table for import status. It will initially say
"0 records are available to manage hierarchically...." - reload the page after a few minutes, the number here should roughly match the 
"xxxx records have been seeded value."

### Reseeding

Duplicates are not possible in a hierarchy, and various technical issues prevent us from silently ignoring them. Re-seeding any 
overlapping taxa are likely to cause conflict. After the last seed operation has completed, you may click the "delete what you've seeded"
link to clear the way for new imports. 

## Errors

The import will almost always produce a mismatch in the number of records and several errors. Common problems are explained here;
contact a DBA for assistance.

### Count mismatch: too many

Counts between seeded records and imported records should match, but seldom will. Too many records in the local dataset is an indication
of terms used in classifications not also existing as names; these may be created as part of the repatriation process and generally are
not problematic. These data will need CAREFUL review before names are created. Click "Click here to view records which are in your import 
but not in Arctos," download CSV, VERY carefully review all data removing anything that is not a "valid" name, and work with a DBA to create
these names.

### Count mismatch: too few

Click "import error details" for a list of terms which were in your seed (e.g., because they had a term "Mammalia" ranked "class" and 
you seeded class=Mammalia) but are not in the final import. The most common problem is incomplete or inconsistent classification data
in Arctos. For example, name Abrothrix andinus has species "Abrothrix andina" or Mustela erminea richardsoni has subspecies 
Mustela erminea richardsonii.

### Count mismatch: too few continued

"Seeded taxa not in your dataset" are similar to the above, but are generally missing classification data. The most common cause is
missing a root term - genus-->{no species}-->scientific_name for a binomial, for example.

### Nowhere to be found

A taxonomic import filter is seldom sufficient to find all taxa in use by a collection, often because a collection is using taxa with 
incomplete, missing, or mis-placed classifications. Work with a DBA to get these into the hierarchical editor as early as possible.

# Example: Import from Arctos, export to new Source

Open the hierarchical editor and create a source if you haven't already.
