# How to Encumber Locality Information

[Encumbrances](/documentation/encumbrance) restrict certain aspects of specimen/lot records from the public view, usually to protect personal identity, proprietary data, or the provenance of a vulnerable population/habitat. Many encumbrances are temporary and may be reversed when specified conditions change (publication of research, expiration or retraction of encumbering legislation, eradication of critical habitat where specimen/lots were collected, etc.). This document describes the various ways that locality information may be encumbered in Arctos.

## Encumbering Coordinates

If the only locality data that needs to be encumbered are coordinates, using the encumbrance funcionality in Arctos may be the best option. See [How to Create an Encumberance](https://github.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/blob/gh-pages/_how_to/How-to-Create-an-Encumbrance.markdown)
