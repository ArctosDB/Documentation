# How to Handle Paleontolgy in Arctos

Paleonotological data can be challenging, but it can also be very rewarding to work with in Arctos. This How-To documents some of the common issues confronted when entering paleontology data in Arctos and offers solutions developed by the collections who have already addressed them. As always, if a solution appears less-than-optimal, [file an issue](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues/new/choose) and help make Arctos better for everyone!
