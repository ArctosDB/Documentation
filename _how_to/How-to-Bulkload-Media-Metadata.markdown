# How to Bulkload Media Metadata

After uploading, the directory can be used to build a media bulkloader file which creates media objects using the uploaded files in Arctos.


We'll use this directory to demonstrate.

https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/UAF/uam_ento/2018_05_22/

Thumbnails are:

https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/UAF/uam_ento/2018_05_22/tb/

and are prefixed with "tn_"

Open the bulkloader

and paste the directory URL in to the "Directory URL" box and click the accompanying button.

The pattern of these filenames is {barcode}{sometimes underbar}{dot}{jpg}

ignore folders with "Filter for extension (eg, ".jpg")"

regexfind=_.*$ captures the information before the first underbar for variable "[filename]." (This common situation is documented in the inline documentation at the top of the page.)

Preview Directory URL is the folder containing the thumbnails

Preview prefix (eg, "tn_") - enter "tn_" to prepend to the image filenames

Preview extension (eg, ".jpg") - enter ".jpg" for jpg previews

Select a license, media type, and mime type.

The bulkloader will accept a part's barcode as a proxy to cataloged items. We've extracted that from the filename with the regex above,
so all that's necessary is to include the variable in relationship term.

Scroll down, click "build/rebuild," confirm that everything worked as expected, download CSV, fill in any remaining blanks (or use the
tool to do so before downloading), load to the media bulkloader, wait for email.
