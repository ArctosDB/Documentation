# How To Bulkload Media Metadata

After uploading, the directory can be used to build a media bulkloader file which creates media objects using the uploaded files in Arctos. Media uploaded using any of the tools available in Arctos will be stored at https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/arctos-s3/

We'll use this directory to demonstrate.

https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/arctos-s3/jegelewicz/2020-04-02/

Thumbnails are:

https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/arctos-s3/jegelewicz/2020-04-02/tn/

and are prefixed with "tn_"

### Get a Media Metadata Bulkload Template

From the Arctos main menu select [Enter Data > Batch Tools > Bulkload Media Metadata](https://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadMedia.cfm). You will see this

Select the information you want to include in the template, then select "get template". You will be asked what you want to do with the file.

Open the file with Excel and you will have a worksheet with all of the headers needed to bulkload your media metadata.

### Complete the Media Metadata Bulkload File

#### MEDIA_URI
This field should hold the URI for the media itself. From our example. The directory appears as follows:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArctosDB/documentation-wiki/gh-pages/tutorial_images/media/Media_To_Bulkload_Metadata_1.jpg)

The URI for each of the three images is the root directory which appears in the search bar of your browser (red box), plus the filename that appears in the list (purple box).

You can use the CONCATENATE function in Excel to create the URIs. Copy the root directory and paste it into the first column of a blank Excel worksheet, copy the filenames and place them into the next column to the right, then use the CONCATENATE function to put them together.

Select enter and you have it! Copy the CONCATENATE formula down for all files in the batch.

Use the Copy/Paste Special Values Only to put the complete URIs into your MEdia Metadata Bulkload Template.

#### MIME_TYPE
Enter the appropriate value from the [code table](https://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTMIME_TYPE).

#### MEDIA_TYPE
Enter the appropriate value from the [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=ctmedia_type).

#### PREVIEW_URI
This field should hold the URI for the media thumbnail. From our example, the directory of thumbnail images can be found in the tn/ folder of the MEDIA_URI folder above. Double click the tn/ (red box) to view the directory.

The URI for each of the three images is the root directory which appears in the search bar of your browser (red box), plus the filename that appears in the list (purple box). Note - in this example, only two thumbnails were created during image upload. See **NEED INSTRUCTIONS** for creating thumbnails if you need to create a thumbnail manually. Metadata can be created without a thumbnail.

You can use the CONCATENATE function in Excel to create the URIs. Copy the root directory and paste it into the first column of a blank Excel worksheet, copy the filenames and place them into the next column to the right, then use the CONCATENATE function to put them together (see directions above).

#### MEDIA_LICENSE
Enter the appropriate value from the [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTMEDIA_LICENSE).

#### MEDIA_LABEL
Up to 10 labels can be added using this tool and label types are controlled by a [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTMEDIA_LABEL). Adding description and made date labels, while not required, will help in locating media via media search.

#### MEDIA_RELATIONSHIP
Up to 5 relationships can be made between the media and Arctos data objects. Relationships are controlled by a [code table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTMEDIA_RELATIONSHIP). Adding at least one relationship is recommended, this is how media is displayed in Arctos. The most used relationship is with a cataloged item (shows cataloged_item). The value for this relationship should be the GUID for the related cataloged item.

**Pro Tip** Naming files so that they include the GUID makes this task easier. With a few strategic find/replace moves in Excel the file name can be tranformed into the GUID. Also, the bulkloader will accept a part's barcode as a proxy to cataloged items this can also be incorporated into the filename so that it can be extracted from the filename.

### Small Batch Media Upload Tool Modification

For use with small batch media uploader tool - see full documentation at [How to Upload Media to TACC](/how_to/How-to-Upload-Media-to-TACC)

#### Modify Media Metadata Bulkload File

The file that you receive once your image upload is complete contains much of the information required to bulkload media.  Remember that although your media are now stored at TACC, they are not associated with any data in Arctos. The [Bulkload Media Metadata](http://arctos.database.museum/tools/BulkloadMedia.cfm) tool will allow you to complete this process.

This file will be deleted 3 days after the message is sent, but may be regenerated from the "existing jobs" link on the [Upload Images](http://arctos.database.museum/tools/uploadMedia.cfm) tool page.
