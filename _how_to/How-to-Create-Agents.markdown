#How to Create Agents#

(Based on a guide initally developed by April Payne, Northern Michigan University)

**Making a New Agent:**

Manage Data > Agents

First off, it is important to check if the agent you want to create already exists. Do this by typing in the last name in the “Any part of any name” box and clicking “Search”. If there are no current agents that use that name, you are good to go.

* To create an agent, click “Create Agent” in the blue box.
* A pop up will open asking you to select “Agent Type”.
* Click the yellow box and it will drop down a menu to choose from.
* Choose the appropriate agent type, e.g., Michigan DNR = organization, Kurt Galbreath = person.
* Next, in the “Preferred Name” field, type what you want your agent’s name to be.
* Note: Other variations of the name can be attached to this agent later.
* Use a full name with middle initial, e.g., Kurt E. Galbreath
* Next to “Autogenerate name components from preferred name” click the “[ if blank ]” link.
* Add in any remarks you may have and click “Create Agent.”
* Your new agent will appear on the right hand side of the Agent page you started on.
* Scroll down and you can see the things that can be added to this agent.

**Agent Names:**

* It is a good idea to add different variations of the name to make it easier to find. Someone may type in Kurt Galbreath, Kurt G., or K. Galbreath but the preferred name is Kurt E. Galbreath. So add each of the variations in this section so the preferred name will come up when any of those are used.

**Agent Status:**

* This section is used mostly with people as agents. If the person is alive, choose “alive.” If you know them to be dead, choose “dead.”
* For agents that are organizations or groups, this is not needed.

**Relationships:**

* This is also used with people as agents. It is useful to connect any students to another person such as Kurt E. Galbreath.
* For agents that are organizations or groups, this can link them with any other agents. Such as NMU linked to Kurt Galbreath.

**Address:**

* This is useful for mainly organizations or groups, especially when sending out loans. Enter in any of the agent’s contact info, e.g., phone number, email, fax and address.
* Once you have entered all the information about your agent you can click “Save Changes” at the bottom of the screen and it will be saved.
