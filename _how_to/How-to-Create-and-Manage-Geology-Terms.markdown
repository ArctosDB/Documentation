# How To Create and Manage Geology Terms

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating and managing geology terms and relationships in the [Geology Attributes Code Table](http://arctos.database.museum/info/ctDocumentation.cfm?table=CTGEOLOGY_ATTRIBUTE). In order to access the functions described in this How To, an Arctos Operator must have [MANAGE_CODETABLES](http://arctos.database.museum/Admin/user_roles.cfm) access. If you need a new term added to the code table and you do not have appropriate access, please file a new [Authority Request](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=authority-request.md&title=) in [Arctos GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues)

## Create a New Term

To create a new geology term, from the Arctos main menu select Manage Data > Metadata > Code Tables

Scroll down the list of Code Tables to CTGEOLOGY_ATTRIBUTE and select that table by clicking the link (or go directly to [CTGEOLOGY_ATTRIBUTE](http://arctos.database.museum/Admin/CodeTableEditor.cfm?action=editGeologyTree))
