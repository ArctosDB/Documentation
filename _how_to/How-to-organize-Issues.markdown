# The Arctos Working Group Playbook

Add a Milestone to all [open Issues without one](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Amilestone+sort%3Acreated-asc)

Review [open Wish List Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Wish+List%22+sort%3Acreated-asc); recategorize when resources (funding, new technology) become available.

Discuss [open Needs Discussion Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Needs+Discussion%22+sort%3Acreated-asc). Goal: Change them all to "Next Task."

Prioritize [open Next Task Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Next+Task%22+sort%3Acreated-asc).

Review [open Active Development Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Active+Development%22+sort%3Acreated-asc). Stalled Issues may need recategorized; ensure that completed Issues have been closed.
