# The Arctos Working Group Playbook

## Community

Issues should be categorized and prioritized by The Community. 

Issues filed as [Bugs](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABug) should be sorted and categorized first.

All [open Issues without a milestone](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Amilestone+sort%3Acreated-asc) should be sorted and categorized.

[Open Wish List Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Wish+List%22+sort%3Acreated-asc) should be periodically reviewed, and recategorized when resources (such as funding or new technology) become available.

Discuss [open Needs Discussion Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Needs+Discussion%22+sort%3Acreated-asc). Goal: Change them all to "Next Task."

Prioritize [open Next Task Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Next+Task%22+sort%3Acreated-asc).

Review [open Active Development Issues](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Active+Development%22+sort%3Acreated-asc). Stalled Issues may need recategorized; ensure that completed Issues have been closed.

*  [Active Development](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A%22Active+Development%22+)
