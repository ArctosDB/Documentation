For most tasks, you will find yourself working to edit localities that have previously been created by another researcher or curator. Occasionally, however, you will have to create a new locality, whether to assign new events or to clean up messy data. Fortunately, the process is straightforward.

* From the front page of Arctos, find the “Create Locality” button. It is nested within the “Location” tab, which is itself nested within the “Manage Data” dropdown menu. Clicking on the link will open up a pretty bare looking page. Luckily, this bareness is your signal that the rest of the process will be simple enough.

* There are only a few fields on the Create Locality page to be filled in. The higher geography of your new locality can be selected in the same manner as discussed in correcting/editing higher geography for an established locality. You can type directly into all of the other fields, then click “Save” to move on.

* Clicking “Save” will bring us back to a familiar page. After creating the new locality, you will be redirected to its Edit Locality page so that you can make additional changes. The changes you may be interested in making are outlined in the section on how to edit specific locality. Also be sure to make a note of your new Locality ID number given at the top of the page.
