**[Enter Data > Bulkload Tools > Parts > Bulkload Parts]()**

## [Bulkload Parts Template](#bulkload-parts-template)

If you do not have a Bulkload Parts Data sheet, begin with the [Bulkload Parts Template]().

Now click on “Download Template” located below the small table and above the large table. Your file will automatically be put into your computer’s downloads.

## Helpful Hints:

* Any header can be deleted, added, or rearranged in the excel sheet manually.

Be sure edited cells do not have an invisible lead or end, otherwise Arctos will reject it. 

* You may notice the bulkload template has a large number of fields for parts, attributes, collector, etc. These are there only if you need them. You may or may not use them all and that is ok. They can be left blank.

* The bulkloader only allows for one part attribute per part. If you need to add more attributes, consider bulkloading the records without parts and then bulkloading parts with the Part Bulkload Tool.
